    "title": "Secure PDF Server",
    "description": "For this assignment, you will create an Express + Nginx proxy manager server that serves a front-facing website with PDF document management capabilities. You will implement custom modules to handle routing, PDF discovery, and PDF validation. Additionally, you will set up your site with a domain name and HTTPS support.

    "title": "Wild West Forum",
    "description": "Build an extremely insecure web forum as a stepping stone before we get to building more secure applications with databases. The application allows users to create minimal “accounts,” log in via a session cookie, and post comments. Views must be implemented using Handlebars with partials (e.g., a navigation bar). The entire stack must be containerized using Docker and the project must be maintained in a Git repository."
